I faced some challenges and solve them so I learned a lot. That is:

1)In step1 when I connect the project with firebase then it has some issues with compiling. I searched it in google then find that minSDK version must be changed to 21 in build. Gradle to solve. In step2 there is nothing that went challenging. In step3 some features are challenging to me.

2) Another problem was widget overflow. I solved it by adjusting the height and width. But I hope the UI works perfectly for all devices.

3)And finally  I create the apk.
In this project, StackOverflow, Medium, and Flutter documentation helped me a lot.

Thanks
